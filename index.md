        <h3><b>Progress Report: </h3></b>
        <h1><ul><i>Aldo Ndreu FM Tuner - Progress Report Week 10</h1></ul></i><br>
<p>
The project which I decided to undertake this semester was working with the si4703 FM Tuner sensor. I wanted to do this project while having one goal in mind at the end. That goal was to actually get radio stations playing so that I could actually hear music. This project took a while to complete as I had to do many things before I could actually connect and work with the sensor. Before I even started working on this project, I had to do some of the documentations such as proposal, project schedule, budget, and even the unboxing of my Raspberry Pi. Once I got all of those things sorted, I then had to research how I was going to connect my sensor with the Raspberry Pi which I was able to do. I was then able to follow all the steps given and was able to provide an actually project with the si4703 sensor working.<br>

I feel like I have actually made good progress in meeting the objectives of my project as defined in my proposal. My main objective was to actually hear radio stations playing when I ran my code. I am able to do that as I’m able to tune into different radio stations and play high quality stations. I am still not sure if can implement my sensor with an LCD in order to display information such as the station being played. After that, I still have to implement a database soon which I am hopeful of getting it to save and store different radio stations. I believe I have met my main requirement in this project and now am looking at if I can do anything else to add on to it.<br>

I didn’t encounter any problems while working on this project as I found everything to be straight forward. The only changes I had to make was switching my project over from the Arduino Pro Mini over to the Raspberry Pi. The guide that I was following showed how to connect this project on the Arduino Pro Mini. I decided to follow that route first just to get a feel of how this project was going to look like. I had to solder male header pins on the FM Tuner board and then connect it with specific parts made specifically for the Arduino Pro mini such as the FTDI board. The transition to the Raspberry Pi was a smooth one since most of the connections were the same. The only thing I needed to change was the code so I which I had to find in order to work with my Raspberry Pi.
Since I started doing this project on the Arduino Pro Mini, that required me to buy some extra parts which I would not need when I transitioned my project to the Raspberry Pi such as the FTDI board. All these expenses did not cost me a lot and I did not have any financial issues while doing this project. All of these parts which I acquired for this project have been updated in my project schedule as shown in my blog.<br>

  <ul>
  <li>I was able to cut the trace near the IC1 on my PCB board</li>
  <li>Was able to complete the placard by collaberating with my future group</li>
  <li><b>Build Script:</b><br> 
    During my 30 seconds build video, I will start off by featuring an opening title screen with the project name and my name. After that, I will display all the parts I need in order to build the FM Tuner which should take a few seconds. I will also show all the parts when they are assembled and connected to my platform which will take another few seconds. Once I have everything set up, I will show the project being powered up and then quickly describe the functionality in which I will demonstrate. This process will take some time but I should be able to condense everything I need to say and do within around 30 seconds.</li>
